We are aware that in this game there is an isue with cutscenes/ movies not scaling properly and playing in a small box. This issue is currently being worked on with hopes of being fixed,
so keep an eye on any future updates where this problem may be fixed but for now please be patient on this matter, Thankyou.

Make sure you got the 1.3 patch for this game before you play it its important you can get it here

you can edit settings in d3d8.ini 

Default for resolution is 2 (1920 x 1080) resolution and aspect ratio edits are done together so you only have to choose your resolution.

Default for FOV is 0 which is off/ original game FOV you can set it out using either = 1,2, 3 or 4 each one will set camera zoomed out further incrementally. 

Default for FPS is 60 would recommend leaving it set to this personally but its up to you to change it you may experience issues.
